# Community Data Analysis

The challenge for this project was to analyze the data collected during a company community survey. Screenshots are utilized to show the layout of the dashboard while also limiting any company data from expossure. 

The project started with the survey being sent out to the community members through Microsoft Forms. The data collected was then downloaded into an Excel format. 
Python/Pandas was utilized to review the column headers, standardize the column headers, and append roughly 70 communities together. There was approximately 4300 data entries. Communities vary in the number of responses.
